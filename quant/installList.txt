Here is a list of all packages to install for a complete environment:


pip (python package manager, lets you install the other packages)
numpy
scipy
pandas
matplotlib.pyplot (plotting similar to matlab)

ipython (vastly imporoved interactive shell) **
emacs (best text editor, not vim) **

** - Not necessary, but that's what I use.
